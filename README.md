   #                                                          👋 Hi, I'm Zackery C.

**14 (Turning 15 in a week) - Self-taught ML Infrastructure Engineer**

Focused on GPU kernel optimization, ML systems, and quantitative analysis of computational ROI.

# 😎 About Me!

I am from the beautiful coast of Cali, San Diego. I have been fascinated with technology ever since my parents purchased me my first device. I started self-studying Artificial Intelligence when I was 13 years old, driven by a passion for optimization, pushing the boundaries of technology, and eventually found my passion in Machine Learning and GPU Optimization to power the most modern AI systems. 



**My goal!**
- Develop a high-performance AI infrastructure that is faster, more efficient, and financially justified at a larger scale.

# **👾Currently Learning Now** (I started Dec 27, 2025 - 4 hours/day)
- Mathematics for Machine Learning (Linear Algebra to Multivariable Calculus)
- GPU programming fundamentals (Triton, CUDA preparation) 
- You should definitely read this - it's awesome; https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-blackwell-architecture?ncid=no-ncid
- Quantitative modeling for hardware optimization impact
- Daily public accountability on Twitter for the next 365 days and deliverables varying from notebooks, benchmarks, and technical notes. 

**🚀 Trajectory**
- Developing my passion to become an excellent ML infrastructure engineer by 16, and an intern at my dream company, NVIDIA, with a portfolio of:
- Optimized GPU kernels to demonstrate measurable speed-ups above PyTorch baselines.
- End-to-end ML systems with distributed training via courses from available college courses.
- Financial models quantifying ROI and TCO of optimizations.
